# ARGonaut
The ARGonaut metagenomic/transcirptomic/viromic program pipeline, is a comprehensive computational framework designed for studying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in environmental samples.


Overview:
The ARGonaut pipeline is a comprehensive computational framework designed for studying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in environmental samples, particularly from wastewater. The pipeline integrates multiple cutting-edge bioinformatics tools and databases to analyze both DNA and RNA sequences, providing insights into the presence, abundance, and dissemination mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). In addition, the pipeline is equipped to handle both short-read (Illumina) and long-read (Nanopore) sequencing technologies, making it versatile and well-suited for various types of sequence data.

Features:
Quality Control: Utilizes FastQC and NanoPlot for short and long reads, respectively.
Assembly: Employs SPAdes and Flye for assembling short and long reads.
Taxonomic Profiling: Uses MetaPhlAn4 and Kraken2 for identifying microbial communities.
Binning: Integrates MetaBAT2, MaxBin2, and CONCOCT for short reads; SemiBin for long reads.
AMR Gene Identification: Incorporates DeepARG and AMRfinder.
Functional Annotation: Utilizes CAT/BAT for annotating bins.
Validation: Uses CheckM for quality assessment of bins.
Metatranscriptomics: For functional genomics, the pipeline incorporates tools like Salmon and featureCounts.
Viromics: Includes VirSorter2 for studying viral communities and their potential role in AMR.
Artificial Intelligence: Incorpaorates several ML algorithms to detect and predict AMRs in wastewater samples. They are also specifically programmed/engineered by the author for the pipeline for a desired effect.

Requirements:
Linux-based operating system
Docker
Nextflow or other workflow management tools
